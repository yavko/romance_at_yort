[name] grew up as a child from the outer edges of Yort, a land that was governed by the Duke of Yort. They lived with their mother, who always did her best to ensure that [name] had all the necessities. One day, when [name] was only six years old, a funny man entered through their door, with expectations to adopt them. Apparently, he was of high-ranking status: a Count. He wanted to adopt [name] to replace his long lost son whom his wife was still grieving over. The noble promised the mother that their child would receive ample education for their future at a place that all parents dream of sending their children to: Yort High School. [name]’s mother was shocked at the offer, but in her eyes it was for the best. This man could give [name] the life that she couldn’t give their. And so, [name] ended up following the man into the carriage on their way to the Duke’s house.
